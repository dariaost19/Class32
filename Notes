Data-driven testing is a software testing methodology that involves using data to drive the testing process. Instead of using a fixed set of inputs and expected outputs for each test case, data-driven testing involves using different sets of data to create multiple test cases
FileHandling :

           In java is reading and writing data to files is called fileHandling.

    1) To read or write the data first we need to know the path or location where we will be reading or writing that file.

    2) We need to navigate to that location or bring the file into the memory so that java program can process the data from that file.

      We use two classes to navigate one is called FileInputStream and the other one is called FileOutputStream.

      When we have to read the data we use FileInputStream and when we have to write the data we use the FileOutputStream.

     3) We need to know about a class that knows how to read and write the data from that specific file for example we use Properties

     class when we have to read the data from the  .properties file. We use XSSFWorkbook to read and write the date from the Excel files.


  Why should we learn about FileHandling?
